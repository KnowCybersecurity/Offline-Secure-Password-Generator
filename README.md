Offline Secure Password Generator was made for and during ConUHacks' 2023 Hackathon.

## My inspiration(s)
Mostly what inspired and motivated me to participate in this year's ConUHacks' hackathon event, even though I'm not as good as everybody else that attended, is my passion for cybersecurity, networking and creating.

## What it does
This python program generates and displays a secure password that's 20 characters long and contains at least two uppercase letters, two numbers and two special characters.

## How I built it
I built this project using Python and the additional knowledge I got from CSE's workshop.

## Challenges I ran into
The main challenges I ran into were logic errors in my code and tiredness from lack of sleep from the night before.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Completing and submitting a project for my first-ever hackathon!

## What we learned
I learned to have fun and socialize during these types of events.

## What's next for Secure Password Generator
Possibly an option to export the generated password onto an encrypted text file that you can store locally on your device.
